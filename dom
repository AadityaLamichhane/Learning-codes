Learning DOM

Noticing point :
 When we select the element using the queryselector all we get the node list 
and when we slect using the classname then we get the html collection 
even though i previously thought it was object before learning anything when i learn a little i assumed it to be the array but its neither 
its close to array but cant use function to the html collection map and push any of that 

Solution : Well Array.from('name of the collection variable ') can be use to make the new array which again can be stored and can be used ..
still in nodelist foreach can be used so that can be considered a pretty good solution
